pandas is built on NumPy and Matplotlib
NumPy: multidimensional array objects for easy data manipulation that Pandas uses to store data
Matplotlib: powerful data visualization capabilities

Rectangular data > columns and rows
Rectangular data in pandas are saved in DataFrames
Different columns can have different data types

dogs.head()
returns first few rows of the data frame
this is a good way to query large dataframes without querying the entire dataset

dogs.info()
names of columns and datatypes and if has missing values

dogs.shape
rows then columns
attribute and not method, no () at end

dogs.describe()
summary statistics for numerical data
count, mean, median, std, max, etc

dogs.values
yields 2d numpy array

dogs.columns
get all labels for columns

dogs.index
row names
these are index objects 
allows for flexibility in labels (eg. can use row names or row numbers)

The Zen of Python by Tim Peters, Item 13
Pandas does not follow this philosophy
Pandas is a swiss-army knife, allowing you to choose best way to solve

Course covers the most important and relevant ways of doing things

##Exercise 1:

homelessness = {
    'store': [1, 2, 1, 2, 1],
    'type': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A'],
    'department': [1, 1, 2, 2, 3],
    'date': ['2023-01-01', '2023-01-01', '2023-01-08', '2023-01-08', '2023-01-15'],

# Create the DataFrame from the dictionary
homelessness = pd.DataFrame(homelessness)

# Print the head of the homelessness data
print(homelessness.head())

# Print information about homelessness
print(homelessness.info())

# Print the shape of homelessness, Shape is not a method so do not need () at the end
print(homelessness.shape)

# Print a description of homelessness
print(homelessness.describe())

## Exercise 2:

# Import pandas using the alias pd
import pandas as pd

# Print the values of homelessness
print(homelessness.values)

# Print the column index of homelessness
print(homelessness.columns)

# Print the row index of homelessness
print(homelessness.index)

"""
Sorting and subsetting

dogs.sort_values("column_name", ascending=False)
dogs.sort_values(["column_name_1", "column_name_2"], ascending = [True,False])

dogs["name"]
just return a specific column

dogs[["breed","height_cm]]
outer brackets subset dataframe
inner brackets creating list of column names to subset

dogs["height_cm"] > 50 
# Dogs whose height is more than 50 cm
yields true or false if the row meets the criteria

dogs[dogs["height_cm"] > 50]
yields all row information that meet criteria

dogs[dogs["breed"] == "Labrador"]
yields all row information for labradors

Subsetting based on dates
dogs[dogs["date_of_birth"] < "2015-01-01"]
yields all row information that meets date requirement
Dates are in quotes and written "YYYY-MM-DD"

is_lab = dogs["breed"] == "Labrador"
is_brown = dogs["color"] == "Brown"
# In one line
dogs[(dogs["breed] = "Labrador") & (dogs["color"] == "Brown")]
dogs[is_lab & is_brown]
# This filters dogs df using both filters

subsetting using .isin()

is_black_or_brown = dogs["color"].isin(["Black", "Brown"])
